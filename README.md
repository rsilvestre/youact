# Youact

A tool to retrieve channel activities from YouTube. Youact allows you to easily fetch channel activities (uploads, likes, playlist additions, etc.) from YouTube using the official YouTube Data API.

## Installation

Add `youact` to the list of dependencies inside `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:youact, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

This package requires Elixir 1.15 or later and has the following dependencies:
- poison ~> 6.0 (JSON parsing)
- httpoison ~> 2.2 (HTTP client)
- typed_struct ~> 0.3 (Type definitions)
- nimble_options ~> 1.0 (Option validation)

## YouTube API Key Setup

Youact uses the official YouTube Data API to fetch channel activities. You'll need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the "YouTube Data API v3" for your project
4. Create an API key in the "Credentials" section
5. Set up the API key in one of the following ways:

### Environment Variable (recommended)

```bash
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Application Configuration

```elixir
# In config/config.exs
config :youact, 
  youtube_api_key: "your_api_key_here"
```

**Note**: Be careful not to commit your API key to version control. Consider using environment variables or a secrets management solution in production.

## Usage

### Get Channel Activities

**Youact.get_channel_activities(channel_id)**

Retrieves activities from a YouTube channel by channel ID.

```elixir
Youact.get_channel_activities("UC5_L-VbFcOOCp6xDCQB4Aog")

{:ok, [
  %Youact.ActivityDetails{
    id: "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3",
    channel_id: "UC5_L-VbFcOOCp6xDCQB4Aog",
    title: "New Video Title",
    description: "Description of the activity...",
    published_at: "2023-01-15T14:30:45Z",
    thumbnail_url: "https://i.ytimg.com/...",
    activity_type: "upload",
    video_id: "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    playlist_id: ""
  },
  # ...more results
]}
```

### Error Handling

All functions return either:
- `{:ok, result}` for successful operations
- `{:error, reason}` when something goes wrong

Possible error reasons:
- `:not_found` - The channel or activities couldn't be found
- `:parse_error` - Error parsing the response from YouTube
- `:unknown_error` - An unknown error occurred
- Other string messages directly from the YouTube API

### Bang Functions

If you don't need to pattern match `{:ok, data}` and `{:error, reason}`, there is also a trailing bang version that raises an exception on error:

```elixir
# Returns the activities directly or raises an exception
activities = Youact.get_channel_activities!("UC5_L-VbFcOOCp6xDCQB4Aog")
```

## Data Schema

### Youact.Activity

A struct representing a YouTube channel activity request:

```elixir
%Youact.Activity{
  channel_id: "UC5_L-VbFcOOCp6xDCQB4Aog"
}
```

Fields:
- `channel_id` (required): The YouTube channel ID

### Youact.ActivityDetails

The activity details struct containing information about each activity:

```elixir
%Youact.ActivityDetails{
  id: "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3",     # Activity ID from YouTube
  channel_id: "UC5_L-VbFcOOCp6xDCQB4Aog",          # YouTube channel ID
  title: "New Video Title",                         # Activity title
  description: "Description of the activity...",    # Activity description (may be empty)
  published_at: "2023-01-15T14:30:45Z",            # ISO 8601 formatted publication date
  thumbnail_url: "https://i.ytimg.com/...",        # URL to thumbnail image (may be empty)
  activity_type: "upload",                         # Type of activity (see below)
  video_id: "dQw4w9WgXcQ",                        # ID of the video (if applicable)
  playlist_id: ""                                  # ID of the playlist (if applicable)
}
```

#### Activity Types

The `activity_type` field can have the following values:
- `"upload"` - Channel uploaded a video
- `"playlistItem"` - Channel added a video to a playlist
- `"like"` - Channel liked a video
- `"favorite"` - Channel favorited a video
- `"comment"` - Channel commented on a video
- `"subscription"` - Channel subscribed to another channel
- `"recommendation"` - Channel recommended a video
- `"social"` - Channel shared a video on a social platform
- `"channelItem"` - Channel posted a channel update
- `"unknown"` - Activity type couldn't be determined

Video ID and playlist ID will only be populated for the relevant activity types:
- `video_id` is populated for: upload, playlistItem, like
- `playlist_id` is populated for: playlistItem, channelItem

### Helper Functions

Youact provides helper functions for working with activity data:

```elixir
# Format date from ISO 8601 to human-readable
Youact.ActivityDetails.format_date(activity) # => "Jan 15, 2023"
```

## Caching

Youact includes a flexible caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce API calls to YouTube.
The cache system supports multiple backend options:

- **Memory**: In-memory cache using ETS tables (default, fast but not persistent)
- **Disk**: Persistent local storage using DETS (survives application restarts)
- **S3**: Cloud storage using AWS S3 (survives restarts and shareable across instances)
- **Cachex**: Distributed caching using Cachex (supports horizontal scaling across multiple nodes)

### Using Caching

If using Youact as an application (included in your supervision tree), caching is automatically enabled. Otherwise, you need to manually start the cache:

```elixir
# Start cache
Youact.start()
```

### Cache Configuration

You can configure cache behavior in your config:

```elixir
# In config/config.exs
config :youact, 
  # General cache settings
  cache_ttl: 86_400_000,                    # TTL (time-to-live) - 1 day in milliseconds (default)
  cache_cleanup_interval: 3_600_000,        # Cleanup interval - every hour (default)
  
  # Configure which backend to use for the activities cache
  cache_backends: %{
    # Memory backend (default)
    channel_activities: %{
      backend: Youact.Cache.MemoryBackend,
      backend_options: [
        table_name: :channel_activities_cache,
        max_size: 1000                      # Max entries in memory
      ]
    }
  }
```

### Cache Operations

```elixir
# Check if cache is enabled
Youact.use_cache?()

# Clear cache
Youact.clear_cache()
```

When caching is enabled, activities are stored with a TTL (time-to-live). The cache is automatically cleaned up periodically to prevent storage issues.

## Examples

### Displaying Channel Activities

```elixir
defmodule ActivityProcessor do
  def print_activities(channel_id) do
    case Youact.get_channel_activities(channel_id) do
      {:ok, activities} ->
        activities_summary = activities
          |> Enum.take(5)
          |> Enum.map_join("\n\n", &format_activity/1)
          
        """
        Channel Activities (#{length(activities)} total):
        #{activities_summary}
        """
      
      {:error, reason} -> 
        "Error: #{reason}"
    end
  end
  
  defp format_activity(activity) do
    icon = case activity.activity_type do
      "upload" -> "üìπ"
      "like" -> "üëç"
      "playlistItem" -> "üé¨"
      "subscription" -> "üì¢"
      "comment" -> "üí¨"
      "favorite" -> "‚≠ê"
      "recommendation" -> "üëÄ"
      "social" -> "üîÑ"
      "channelItem" -> "üì∞"
      _ -> "üîî"
    end
    
    """
    #{icon} #{activity.title} (#{Youact.ActivityDetails.format_date(activity)})
    Type: #{activity.activity_type}
    #{if activity.video_id != "", do: "Video ID: #{activity.video_id}", else: ""}
    #{if activity.description != "", do: String.slice(activity.description, 0, 100) <> if(String.length(activity.description) > 100, do: "...", else: ""), else: ""}
    """
  end
end

# Usage:
summary = ActivityProcessor.print_activities("UCt8Nz7iFr4d6F9UrpiUbGwg")
IO.puts(summary)

# Output:
# Channel Activities (42 total):
# üìπ New Video Title (Jan 15, 2023)
# Type: upload
# Video ID: dQw4w9WgXcQ
# Check out this awesome new content that I've created...
# 
# üëç Great Tutorial Video (Jan 12, 2023)
# Type: like
# Video ID: xyzABC123
# This is a video I liked about programming
